        is exactly equal to the number of endings: no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it. 
        In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of <span id="endings" onclick="myFunctionendings()">closings</span> 
        that we cannot even <span id="conceive" onclick="myFunctionconceive()">perceive</span> of it. Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried 
        away by the wind, which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end. 
        Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely <span id="abandoned" onclick="myFunctionabandoned()">discarded</span>. 
        This saying is also attributed to </mark><div class="box"><button class="boxtext"onclick="showHide('liddell')">Stéphane Mallarmé</button>

        for where quotations begin is in a cloud. Paul Valéry also described his <span id="perception" onclick="myFunctionperception()">awareness</span> of first lines so vividly, and to 
        my mind so accurately, that i have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit
        on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to <span id="create" onclick="myFunctioncreate()">build</span> the tre from which such a fruit would fall. 
        In the beginning was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. 
        And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act. that nothing can precede action—no 
        breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive <span id="love" onclick="myFunctionlove()">adore</span> before some kind of act.
        I <span id="believe" onclick="myFunctionbelieve()">suppose</span> the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk 
        about its beginning. Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind. The mind acts, 
        the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a 
        <span id="chaotic" onclick="myFunctionchaotic()">disordered</span> holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house.
    </mark></p>

   
    <p><mark><mark id="indent">&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp</mark> An act of the mind. To <span id="move" onclick="myFunctionmove()">transfer</span>, to <span id="make happen" onclick="myFunctionmakehappen()">accomplish</span>, to make <span id="manifest" onclick="myFunctionmanifest()">demonstrate</span>. Be an act of Congress. 
        A state of real existence rather than possibility. And poets love possibility! They love to <span id="wonder" onclick="myFunctionwonder()">believe</span> and <span id="explore" onclick="myFunctionexplore()">examine</span>. 
        Hard lot! But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks its 
        individual character. A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. to <span id="pretend" onclick="myFunctionpretend()">assume</span>, <span id="feign" onclick="myFunctionfeign()">act</span>, <span id="impersonate" onclick="myFunctionimpersonate()">imitate</span>. 
        That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own <span id="pretension" onclick="myFunctionpretension()">affectation</span>, and has been from its beginning; the human mind 
        is capable of a great elastic theatre. As the poet Ralph angel puts it, “The poem is an <span id="interpretation" onclick="myFunctioninterpretation()">analysis</span> of weird theatrical shit.” 
        the weird theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his 
        actions drama, but no theater; theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside the circle; 
        in other words, self-consciousness is theatre. 
        Everyone knows that if you <span id="query" onclick="myFunctionquery()">question</span> 
        poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of 
        languages, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. And the lesson is always the same, 
        and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you have any idea for a poem, 
        an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. 
        This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error. I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell 
        too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea.  
        Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone 
        is tired of hearing there are <span id="onemillion" onclick="myFunctiononemillion()">1,003,295</span> words used by the Esimo for snow.

                <p class="text"><strong>Ezra Pound</strong><br><br> American Poet (October 30, 1885 – November 1, 1972)</p>
            </div><mark> learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that we each only really speak one 
        sentence in our lifetime. That sentence begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last 
        words right before you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, 
        if you are <span id="blessed" onclick="myFunctionblessed()">sacred</span>, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end. 
        When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of <span id="semicolons" onclick="myFunctionsemicolons()">;&nbsp</span>!” he is absolutely right; 
        the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon 
        (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there 
        exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on 
        connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated. 
    </mark> </p>  
    </div>
    <p><mark><mark id="indent">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</mark> You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, 
        what connects the first line to the last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. 
        Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that intervenes, the 
        first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other.Would not speak to each other. 
        Because the lines of a poem are speaking to each other, not you to them or they to you. I will tell you what I miss: 
        I miss watching a movie and at the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen and say: 
        The End. I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page, at a discrete distance from the last words of the 
        last sentence, are the dark letters spelling The End. 
        It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, with a deep sense of feeling: 
        both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished the book. 
        I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words The End. Why is that, I wonder. 
        I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of energy, 
        no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line.
