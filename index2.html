        And then I found a poem of mine that I had <span id="carefully" onclick="myFunctioncarefully()">attentively</span> written by hand in the sixth grade, 
        and at the bottom of the page, in India ink, <span id="beautifully" onclick="myFunctionbeautifully()">attractively</span> apart from the rest of the text, 
        were the words The End. And I realized children very often <span id="denote" onclick="myFunctiondenote()">indicate</span> the end because it is 
        indeed a great <span id="achievement" onclick="myFunctionachievement()">accomplishment</span> for them to have written anything, and they are completely unaware 
        of the number of stories and poems that have already been written; they know some, of course, 
        but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet. 
        And so they sign their poems and stories like kings. Which is a <span id="wonderful" onclick="myFunctionwonderful()">beautiful</span> thing. Roland Barthes 
        suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing: the ending will have the last word 
        or the ending will be silent or the ending will execute a pirouette, do something unexpectedly <span id="incongruent" onclick="myFunctionincongruent()">disconsonant</span>.

                <p class="text"><strong>Gaston Bachelard</strong><br><br> French philosopher (June 27, 1884 – October 16, 1962)</p>
            </div><mark> says the single most <span id="succinct" onclick="myFunctioninsuccinct()">concise</span> and <span id="astonishing" onclick="myFunctionastonishing()">amazing</span> thing: We begin in admiration 
        and we end by organizing our disappointment. The moment of admiration is the experience of something 
        unfiltered, <span id="vital" onclick="myFunctionvital()">critical</span> and fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the onset 
        of disappointment and its <span id="dignification" onclick="myFunctiondignification()">qualification</span>; the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of 
        some vitality through familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, think about it. 
        I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try <span id="inevitable" onclick="myFunctioninevitable()">unavoidable</span> thing. And if you believe that, 
        then you are conceding that in the beginning was the act, not the word.

                <p class="text"><strong>Cy Twombly</strong><br><br> American painter (April 25, 1928 – July 5, 2011)</p>
            </div><mark> quotes John Crowe Ransom, 
        on a scrap of paper: “The image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.”
        Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some of his drawings and paintings, 
        usually poetry, usually Dante. Many men and women have written long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work. 
        Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: origins (<span id="beginnings" onclick="myFunctionbeginnings()">start</span>) have consequences 
        (<span id="endings" onclick="myFunctionendings()">closing</span>). The poem is the consequence of its origins. 
        Give me the fruit and I will take from it a see and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell. Barbara Henstein Smith, 
        in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this: “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, 
        is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most <span id="gratifying" onclick="myFunctiongratifying()">pleasing</span> 
        ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released. Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an 
        experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”

         <p><mark><mark id="indent">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp </mark> But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems <span id="begin" onclick="myFunctionbegin()">start</span>. 
            How can the origin be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? 
            It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, 
            before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge, 
            and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born. 
            I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, across ages, across cultures, 
            across aesthetic schools, and I have <span id="discovered" onclick="myFunctiondiscovered()">identified</span> that first lines are remarkably similar, even repeated, 
            and that last lines are <span id="remarkably" onclick="myFunctionremarkably()">surprisingly</span> similar, even repeated. Of course in all cases they remain remarkably 
            distinct, because the words belong to completely different poems. And i began to realize, reading these 
            first and last lines, that there are not only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence 
            we each speak but also the first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, 
            by those we listen to. And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and that end are the same:
            in poem after poem I <span id="encountered" onclick="myFunctionencountered()">experienced</span> words that mark the first something made out of language that we hear 
            as children repeated night after night, like a refrain: I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid.
            Go to sleep now. And I encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope 
            to hear on earth: I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now. 
            But it is growing damp and I must go in. Memory’s fog is rising. Among </mark>
